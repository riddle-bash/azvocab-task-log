React: Thinking in React

Identify which one is your state?

1. If its value doesn't change
2. If it call from parent through props
3. If it can be generated from original 

Identify where your state should live

1. Through common parent
2. In some component above common parent
3. If can't find suitable component, create a new component to hold the state

Hooks are special function that let you "hook into" React.

Final stradegy:

1. Identify components that use state:
Seach and check valid
2. Find their common parent:
FilterableProductTable
3. Decide where the state lives:
FilterableProductTable
